There are two .ipynb files;

kaggle.ipynb contains all the process I did, containing some attemption, so it maybe hard to read.

the shorterone.ipynb contains a clear preprocessing and shows how I generate the last submission.

weather.csv is the weather of HK from 2017 to 2018.

test.csv is the last output of model

submit.csv is the last submission on kaggle.
